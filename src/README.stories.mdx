# Welcome to _Dungeons and Components_

**Dungeons and Components** is a React component library for working with mechanics from the Dungeons and Dragons Fifth Edition. It is useful both for adding elements to existing projects, as well as creating standalone projects, or even creating full sourcebooks. It also includes special printing styles so that a browser's _print to PDF_ feature can be utilized to produce a well-formatted PDF.
